My name is Ramnath and I work at [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com), where I drive data science and product analytics. I am deeply addicted to data science, the statistical programming language R, interactive visualizations, 
and javascript.

Prior to joining [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com), I worked at [Alteryx](https://www.alteryx.com) as a data scientist , and as an assistant professor in the [Desautels Faculty of
Management](https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/). I spent a couple of years at [McKinsey and Company](https://www.mckinsey.com) as a business analyst, and
have a PhD in Operations Management from the [Wharton School](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/). I :heart: open-source and have developed several {{< icon name="r-project"
pack="fab" >}} packages, including [htmlwidgets](http://htmlwidgets.org), [slidify](http://slidify.org), and [rCharts](http://github.com/ramnathv/rCharts). I am a frequent speaker at conferences and meetups.

I built this blog with [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), using a
modified version of the amazing [academic](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/)
theme. All posts are released under a Creative Commons
