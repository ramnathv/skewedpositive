Nothing on this website requires you to identify yourself. The only personal
information collected while you visit this site is non-identifying information,
such as browser type and operating system. This information is collected by
Google Analytics for measuring visitor traffic to this site.

I do not collect this information and have no access to it other than as
aggregated reports. Here is the [Google
Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245) privacy page.

This information is collected via cookies. Most web browsers allow you to
control handling of cookies. You can disable all cookies for this website
without in any way reducing the functionality for you.

I have designed this website so that your IP address is anonymised within Google
Analytics and the “Do Not Track” request is respected.

I don’t collect your personal information, so there is nothing I can share.

Google Analytics does collect some information about you. See the Google
Analytics privacy page.

For each visitor to reach the site, Google Analytics collects the following
non-personally identifiable information, including but not limited to browser
type, version and language, operating system, pages viewed while browsing the
site, page access times and referring website address. This information is
presented to me as aggregated reports for the purpose of gauging visitor traffic
and trends.
